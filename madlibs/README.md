# Madlibs

Your job for this assignment is to create a Madlib-esque startup idea generator. In [app.js](js/app.js) you'll find a list of company names and a list of groups of people/animals. In addtion, there is a line at the bottom that combines a random choice from each array. Your job is to create a page that randomly generates startup ideas based on the idea template and the two lists of strings. Your app must do the following things:

1. It must have a button that, when clicked, generates a new (random) idea for a startup using the idea template provided. That idea must be shown on the page somewhere.
2. It must have a button to like, or favorite, the current startup idea.
3. It must dispay a list of all of the favorited startup ideas.

Anything beyond those requirements is up to you, but it must fulfill those requirements. There are no restrictions on looks, so feel free to make it look as you want. Also feel free to add more companies/groups to that list. :)

**Due Date**: This homework is due Monday May 16, before class. Please turn it in by commiting it to an open-source Github repository and then sending me the link in Slack.
